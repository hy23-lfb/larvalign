This is method number 3 for generating the mean and the standard deviation for the rich dataset.

Step1: Individual images are registered to template.
Step2: Upon these images, maximum z-projection is performed to get 2D image out of 3D images. Saved in the directory ./mip/
Step3: Mean stack and standard deviation stack is created out of these 2D images. Saved in the same directory as the readme.txt file i.e., ./mean_and_stddev.fig
